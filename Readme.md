# **Unit-8 PHP Formatting Dynamic Output**

## 8-1:PHP Formatted Content

For this assignment you are going to practice using the `SELECT` command to pull the data from a table in your database.  You will also need to sort the data using the SQL `SORT` command.

Use the attached `wdv341_products.sql` file as the basis for your project. Insert the table into your wdv341 database. 

Use the layout and CSS provided in the `retail-products.php` page.

Do the following:

1. Your program should pull all rows from the table.
2. Sort in Descending order by product name. 
For each row in your table format the content as described in the comments on the `retail-products.php` file. 
    * If there is content in the `product_status` field display the contents and apply the productStatus class to the p container.  
    * If the `product_inventory` is less than 10 then apply the productLowInventory class to the inventory p container.
